    <h1> Thank you all for everything. </h1>
    <p> 
      As some of you may or may not know, I've been struggling to live the past couple weeks. In order to attend school, I had to take out a loan which was extremely expensive. It put me in severe debt. I also recently got robbed on my way to school. Not only did I lose my wallet and phone, but I got slashed by a knife. I had to go to the hospital and get stitches/surgery, which turned out to be very fucking expensive. I am in severe debt which I don't think I'll be able to recover from. Because of these things, I haven't had money to even eat. I haven't ate proper meals in the last 9 days. I'm severely depressed and can't get anti-depressants because my insurance expired. I'm also about to be evicted in 2 weeks, I got my notice a while ago and have not been able to make payments. I really don't want to live anymore, I don't see a point in it. If this news is surprising to you, I'm sorry. I haven't really talked to much people about this, I didn't want anyone to worry about me. I hate being a burden, and I feel like everyone would be better off without me. I'm sorry if I offend you by not telling you. Just know that to those that important to me, I love you and care about you, and I will always look over you :)

      By the time this page is officially up, I will be dead in my room, overdosed on fentanyl. Please don't dwell on my death and move on with your life. I have a will written out, and if you're in it you'll get an automatic e-mail with the will and will reading information exactly 12 hours after this page is up. To my family and friends, I am sorry for the pain my actions will cause you. Please know that I love you all deeply, but I can no longer bear the burden of my own existence. Please understand that this decision was not made lightly. I have thought long and hard about it, weighing the pain I feel against the impact it will have on those I leave behind. Ultimately, I believe that this is the only way to find peace.

    <h2>
      Thank you everyone for everything. I'm sorry I'm leaving this world so soon, and so abruptly. Thank you for everyone that has been there for me and has supported me. I love all of you, and I wish you the best. I hope you're able to reach all your goals. I hope that in time, you will find it in your hearts to forgive me. I ask for no sympathy, only understanding. Thank you, I love you.
